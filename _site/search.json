    "section": "Method for determining how to adjust weights",
    "text": "Method for determining how to adjust weights\nThe last addition to adjust the weights automatically is to find the direction and extent of the weights to be changed. We can accomplish this by using a concept from calculus known as the derivative, which is the slope of the function at a specific point. By finding the slope or derivative, we can determine the direction and amount to change the weights.\n\nSo in this illustration, we can find that the slope at point one is two by using the rise-over run of the tangent line (a line that touches the function at a point). We can use this slope or derivative to determine in what direction and how much to change the weights. This is done because of a property that a derivative has, which is when the derivative is zero, it is at the minimum or maximum (or saddle point) of the function. We can take advantage of this property with our method of measuring the error to find the minimum of the error.\nSo if we keep adjusting the weights and the derivative gets smaller, we are approaching a minimum or maximum (or saddle point). To ensure we are finding the minimum and not the maximum error, we need to figure out what direction we should change the weights. This can be done simply by subtracting the derivative to act as we descend to the minimum. Putting it together\nThe heart of deep learning lies in the ability of neural networks to learn any task by going through five steps. These are:\n1. Input data into the function\n2. Compare the output to the error function (loss function)\n3. Take the derivative of the error function with respect to the weights\n4. Subtract the derivative of the weights from the weights\n5. Repeat until the error is small\n\nEverything else is focused on making the training process efficient and timely."

With these tools, the neural network can learn any task and solve most problem thrown its way.\nToday, we see the applications of neural networks in various fields, including speech recognition, image and pattern recognition, and natural language processing, to name a few.

    "text": "Implementation\nAfter some procrastination and coursework delays, I finally mustered the courage to attempt the implementation. Drawing on lessons from the fastai course, I realized the importance of starting small with concepts I understood, gradually building up from there. I initiated the process with basic tensor multiplication using a convolution kernel (typically a small n x n matrix) and gradually advanced by visualizing each successive step.\nIn my experience, the implementation process can be distilled into four primary steps:\n\n\nRead\nImplement\nVisualize (Test)\nRepeat Steps 1-3\n\n\nThis iterative process, accompanied by ample time and persistence, enables the implementation of any concept, although I recommend starting small to avoid discouragement and an excessively lengthy process. Next, I delve deeper into each of these steps.\n\nRead\nReading is an indispensable step, yet itâ€™s easy to misstep when attempting to implement a paper. The goal isnâ€™t to memorize every word but to understand the core functionality of the process. To achieve this, focus on the essentials:\n\n\nWhat are the inputs and outputs\nWhat change is occuring to the data\nWhat are the assumptions\n\n\nUnderstanding the inputs and outputs is vital as it forms the basis for implementing and testing your model. The transformation of the data is the core of your implementationâ€”itâ€™s the heart of your code. And finally, being aware of the assumptions is critical, as they often affect data preprocessing, output interpretation, and more.\nTo expedite the reading process, it helps to know where to find necessary details. Typically, the most crucial sections in a research paper are:\n\nAbstract\n\nProvides a broad understanding of the paper and its relevance.\n\nFigures\n\nOften encapsulate the paperâ€™s content and are valuable for understanding the modelâ€™s workings. However, ensure their accuracy by cross-referencing the textual content.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHighlights the paperâ€™s novelty or significance.\n\nArchitecture (Can go by other names)\n\nContains detailed descriptions of the architecture (usually where most of your time will be spent).\n\nTraining\n\nProvides hyperparameters for training, model performance, and other essential information.\n\nThe appendix\n\nOften contains implementation details not fitting into the main paperâ€™s flow.\n\nExperiements (Optional)\n\nCan include important data and parameters used for model training.\n\n\n\n\nVisualize (Test)\nAfter you implement something you need to verify the code works as you expected and to do this you can visualize what the outputs are or what the data looks like by using a library like matplotlib. Also it may help to work in an iteractive enviroment like a jupyter notebook so you can immedtialy see the output instead of having to rerun your code everytime. In the same vein of visualizing testing your code with asserts statements or libraries like pytest can help you ensure that your code is working as expected. This will be really useful when you go back to try to figure out why some part of your model may not be working as expected.\nAfter implementation, verify the accuracy of your code. Visualize the outputs or data structures using libraries like matplotlib, or work in an interactive environment like a jupyter notebook for immediate output. Assert statements or testing libraries like pytest can also be helpful to ensure your code performs as expected.\n\n\nRepeat\nThe crux of this process lies in repetition and rapid iteration. Although you might start slow, as you build your knowledge base and develop greater abstractions, the speed of your work will increase. Additionally, this iterative process will enhance your programming skills and your ability to refine your codebase."
