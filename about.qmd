:::{#about}
I’m a curious individual who is broadly interested in topics related to creating intelligent agents.

Currently I'm a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, working on the spoken understanding team at Alexa smart home. Before that I was an Undergraduate Researcher at labs at my university. I'm currently a senior computer science major at The University of Texas at Dallas.

I enjoy reading ML papers, reading books, playing musical instruments, and running.
