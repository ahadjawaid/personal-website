:::{#about}
I'm a Software Engineer, Researcher, and Student. Here, I share my experiences, things I've learned, and the projects I've worked on. I mostly work on projects related to artificial intelligence and software engineering. Right now, I'm an Intern Software Engineer at Amazon and before this, I was doing research at my university.

You can find more about me [here](about.qmd).
