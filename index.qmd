:::{#about}
I'm a Developer and a Researcher who likes to build cool things. Here, I share my experiences, things I've learned, and the projects I've worked on. Right now, I'm a researcher at the SML Lab at UTD and I'm trying to start and launch a product every month until I graduate.

You can view my recent works [here](projects.qmd).

You can find more about me [here](about.qmd).
